# Files Organizer 

Files Organizer is a Python script that helps you organize files in a directory by moving them to subdirectories based on their file extensions. This script creates subdirectories for each unique file extension found in the parent directory and moves the corresponding files into these subdirectories.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've placed the script.

4. Modify the `Parent_dir` variable in the script to specify the path to the directory you want to organize.

```python
parent_dir = r'C:\Your\Parent\Directory\Path'
```

## Requirements

Before using this script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `shutil`: This library provides a high-level interface for file operations, such as moving files and copying them.

- `os`: This library provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing you to work with file paths and directories.

To install these libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install shutil os
```
