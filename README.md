# File Mover

File Mover is a Python script that helps you organize files in a directory by moving them to subdirectories based on their file extensions. This script creates subdirectories for each unique file extension found in the parent directory and moves the corresponding files into these subdirectories.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've placed the script.

4. Modify the `Parent_dir` variable in the script to specify the path to the directory you want to organize.

```python
parent_dir = r'C:\Your\Parent\Directory\Path'
